# DSU-F2023-Social-Intelligence-From-Motions

In this project, we created an interface to predict the emotions of every frame in a video using a series of deep-learning models designed and trained on a dataset called VEATIC. In addition, we evaluated the model from VEATIC by examining the prediction performance in a variety of videos.
